You are given N rectangles and for each rectangle i you know its width wi and its height hi

We call a rectangle i to be independent if there is no other rectangle j such that wi<wj and hi<hj

Count the number of independent rectangles.

Standard input

The first line contains a single integer N.

Each of the following NNN lines contains two values w and h representing the width and the height of a rectangle.

Standard output

Output a single number representing the number of independent rectangles.


Constraints and notes

    1<=N<=10**5
    1<=wi, hi<=10**6
